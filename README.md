# keep-app

This is the keep app similar to google keep to save notes.
In this project i have used HTML5, CSS3 and Pure Javascript.
I have not used any libraries or frameworks here.It is pure Javascript.

In this app you can add notes, delete notes, make duplicate copy of notes.
The notes can also be colorful.So i have added color palette.
You can make the notes colorful with different colors.

The output of code with screenshots have been added to the output folder.

Thank you!
